# v1.10.0 — Async Agent Communication, Atlas UI Redesign & HA Runtime Improvements

## What's New

### Core Features
- **Async Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication Enabled by Default**
  - Agents can now communicate asynchronously; all tenants are automatically migrated and enabled on startup. This unlocks richer cross-agent workflows and automated triggers.
- **Global Single Sign-On (SSO) Domain Toggle**
  - Admins can now control SSO custom domain redirection globally, supporting multi-tenant OAuth flows and improving SSO onboarding for Google and GitHub providers.
- **OAuth Multi-Tenant Flow**
  - Introduced platform OAuth providers for Google and GitHub with support for multi-tenant authentication, enabling seamless org-level onboarding and login.

### UI/UX Enhancements

#### Atlas Onboarding Redesign
- **New Atlas Design System**
  - Agent onboarding now features a four-screen Atlas design system with fresh SVG illustrations, improved Paper/Night themes, particle effects, and wordmark branding.
  - UniverseMap, OriginPlate, and personality chip enhancements create a more engaging and modern onboarding experience.
- **Login Flow Revamp**
  - Reworked login screens, compass visuals, cosmography plates, and input focus behaviors for improved clarity and accessibility.

#### Agent Workspace & File Delivery
- **File Delivery Injection**
  - Files can now be directly injected into agent-to-agent chat sessions, streamlining document sharing between AI agents and users.
- **Workspace File Management Upgrades**
  - File deletion restricted to managers; various improvements to workspace file handling boost security and clarity.

#### Chat Experience & Pagination
- **Cursor-Based Chat History Pagination**
  - Chats now load via efficient cursor-based paged history, ensuring stable performance and better scalability in large conversations.
- **Live Code Streaming**
  - Code execution output is streamed in real time to the code panel, giving immediate feedback and smoother developer experience.

#### Sandbox & Tool Reliability
- **Configurable Code Execution Timeouts**
  - Sandbox now reads timeout from config (up to 1 hour), properly streams partial output for timed out jobs, and provides retry hints for error cases.
- **Tool Log Persistence & Dynamic Relationship Loading**
  - Channel tool logs are now persisted, and relationships are loaded dynamically for robust skill seeding and auditing.

#### UI Polish
- Refined agent and enterprise settings, detail page shells, notification bar behaviors, and onboarding finish protocols.
- Multiple Atlas UI tweaks for login, universe mapping, personality chips, and branding.

### Optimizations

#### High Availability & Deployment
- **HA Runtime Improvements**
  - Deployment scripts and heartbeat logic reworked to support more stable, concurrent high-availability runtime triggers.
  - Atomic heartbeat claims and semaphore concurrency limits prevent duplicate scheduler triggers in multi-instance deployments.

#### Performance & Stability
- **Database Connection Pool Optimized**
  - LLM call connection hold times shortened to prevent DB pool exhaustion and improve response latency.
- **Workspace File Deletion Security**
  - Workspace file deletions now strictly require manager permission, guarding against unauthorized removals.
- **AgentTool Record Backfill**
  - Tools panel now backfills and skips tools without records; respects user-disabled tools in LLM payloads.

#### Storage & Cloud Integration
- **Google Cloud Storage Endpoint Auto-Detection**
  - GCS endpoint is now auto-detected, supporting correct V4 signature configs and resolving compatibility for S3-like APIs.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Trigger Reliability**
  - Race conditions and duplicate triggers eliminated with atomic claim handling and concurrency control.
- **Fixed Google Workspace SSO Routing**
  - Corrected provider routing and org member link handling for all Google Workspace SSO connections.
- **Improved Markdown Rendering & Error Handling**
  - Trigger workflows, markdown rendering, and release workflow robustness improved.
- **Sandbox Output & Timeout Handling**
  - Streaming output logic and truncated error messages fixed for timeout cases in code execution.
- **Release Workflow & Protected Branches**
  - Auto-tagging, draft model updates, and protected `main` branch workflows now handled reliably.
- **Tool Relationship & Persistence**
  - Conditional hiding of OKR reports, backfill record fixes, and support for user-disabled tools.
- **UI Tweaks & Cosmetic Fixes**
  - Atlas login visuals, personality chips, and roster labels adjusted; notification bar and sticky element behaviors improved.
- **DetachedInstanceError & Import Path Corrections**
  - Fixed backend errors in file delivery message injection and chat session handling.
- **AgentBay Logging Override Disabled**
  - Prevents accidental reset of loguru configuration during SDK operations.
- **GCS Signature Issue Resolved**
  - Fixed S3-compatible API SignatureDoesNotMatch for object uploads.

# v1.9.2 — Workspace Governance, Tool UX & Token Cache Accounting

## What's New

### Enterprise Info & Workspace Governance
- **Shared `enterprise_info/` workspace area** now appears as tenant-level company context for agents and users.
- **Agent-side enterprise info is read-only**: agents can list and read company context, but cannot create, edit, or delete shared enterprise files.
- **Admin-managed enterprise knowledge base**: platform and org admins can update enterprise info while regular users and agents are protected from accidental modification.
- **Legacy task files no longer appear in new agent workspaces**: new agents no longer receive `todo.json` / `tasks.json`; existing `tasks.json` files remain supported as legacy snapshots.
- **Workspace file handling polish** improves preview/download behavior for shared enterprise files and preserves read-only boundaries.

### Agent Management & Permissions
- **Company admins can manage company-visible agents** even when those agents were created by regular users.
- **Private user-only agents remain private** to their creator.
- Agent permission APIs now return effective management capability, so the UI can distinguish creator ownership from admin management rights.
- Start, stop, and permission update actions now use effective manager permission instead of creator-only checks.

### Tool Management Experience
- **Agent and company tool lists now share a cleaner grouped UI** with category headers, search, status filters, counts, and bulk toggles.
- Tool categories are easier to scan and can be expanded only when needed, reducing very long tool-list pages.
- Per-tool emoji icons were removed from the main list in favor of calmer category icons and compact labels.
- **`Update Objective` is now a global default tool**, so newly created employees have the OKR objective update capability enabled by default.
- Tool loading now avoids exposing disabled or agent-only tools to the LLM fallback path.

### Chat & Agent UX
- **New and existing chat sessions focus the composer automatically**, so users can type immediately after opening a session.
- **Existing sessions open at the latest message** more reliably.
- **Expanded tool chains now keep following the bottom only while appropriate**: if the user scrolls up intentionally, new tool updates no longer force the viewport back down.
- Duplicate assistant avatars after a tool-chain block were removed for a cleaner transcript.
- Tool-chain copy was refined from "Ran X agents" to clearer activity language.
- Agent expiry quick-renew buttons now show selected state.
- The dashboard's secondary "New Digital Employee" button was removed; creation remains available from the sidebar entry point.

### Token Accounting & Cache Visibility
- Token usage tracking now records input, output, estimated, cache-read, and cache-creation token counters.
- Agent stats expose cache hit information for providers that return cache usage.
- Qwen / Alibaba Bailian compatible calls now support provider-specific prompt cache control while preserving stable prompt prefixes.
- Daily and monthly token reset logic now resets cache counters alongside total token counters.

### Prompting, Webpage Generation & Tool Reliability
- Default webpage/rich-document style guidance moved into the system prompt, reducing repeated tool-description text while keeping generated pages visually consistent.
- Agent-facing reply guidelines now discourage emoji-heavy normal replies.
- Web search instructions now refer to currently enabled tools instead of hardcoding unavailable tool names.
- Tool-call execution now blocks disabled tool names and asks the model to retry malformed JSON tool arguments cleanly.
- HTML-to-PDF and HTML-to-PPT conversion descriptions and parameters were expanded for higher-fidelity Chrome-based rendering.
- Restart script now starts backend and frontend as detached daemons, avoiding local dev servers exiting after the restart command completes.

## Upgrade Guide

> **Database migration required.** Run `alembic upgrade heads` before restarting application services.

This release adds or updates schema/data defaults for:
- agent cache token counters
- daily token usage input/output/cache/estimated counters
- default agent TTL changing to permanent (`0`)
- default daily LLM call limit changing to `1000`

### Docker Deployment

```bash
git pull origin main

# Run database migrations
docker exec clawith-backend-1 alembic upgrade heads

# Rebuild and restart services
docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build
```

### Source Deployment

```bash
git pull origin main

# Run database migrations
cd backend && alembic upgrade heads
cd ..

# Rebuild frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
cd ..

# Restart backend / frontend services
```

### Kubernetes / Helm

```bash
helm upgrade clawith helm/clawith/ -f values.yaml
# Run migration job / command: alembic upgrade heads
```

### Notes
- `enterprise_info/` is now shared tenant context. Review who has platform or org admin roles, because only admins should update those shared files.
- New agents are permanent by default. If your deployment requires expiring agents, set tenant/user TTL defaults explicitly after migration.
- Token cache counters depend on provider usage payloads. Providers that do not return cache fields will continue to show zero cache usage.
- Existing legacy `tasks.json` files are preserved, but new agents will not get `todo.json` or `tasks.json` automatically.
- If you run from source, use the updated `restart.sh` or your own process manager to keep frontend/backend processes detached.

- **Onboarding stability fixes**: prevents ritual leakage into later sessions and avoids duplicate/late onboarding triggers
- **Model picker fixes**: better default syncing, improved dropdown positioning, and clipping fixes
- **Channel user identity reuse and outbound routing** fixed for more reliable cross-channel delivery
- **Agent creation fixes**: template skills and auto-installed MCP tools now attach more consistently
- **Migration graph fixes**: release migrations were stabilized and merged to avoid broken multi-head upgrade paths
- **UI polish fixes** across chat panels, dialogs, agent cards, and company branding

## v1.9.1 — Upgrade Guide

> **Database migration required.** Run `alembic upgrade heads` before restarting application services.

This release introduces new schema changes in the `v1.9.0..main` range, including:
- `tenants.default_model_id`
- `agent_user_onboardings`
- `agent_templates.capability_bullets`
- `agent_templates.bootstrap_content`
- `agent_templates.default_mcp_servers`
- release-head merge migration cleanup

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
git pull origin main

# Run database migrations
docker exec clawith-backend-1 alembic upgrade heads

# Rebuild and restart services
docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build
```

### Source Deployment

```bash
git pull origin main

# Run database migrations
cd backend && alembic upgrade heads
cd ..

# Rebuild frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
cd ..

# Restart backend / frontend services
```

### Kubernetes (Helm)

```bash
helm upgrade clawith helm/clawith/ -f values.yaml
# Run migration job / command: alembic upgrade heads
```

### Notes
- Existing user-agent pairs are automatically backfilled into `agent_user_onboardings`, so established conversations should not be re-onboarded after upgrade.
- If your deployment provisions agents from templates, review any template metadata that now uses `bootstrap_content`, `capability_bullets`, or `default_mcp_servers`.
- If you rely on tenant-scoped model management, validate the new default model selection in Company / Enterprise settings after migration.
- New template-driven MCP auto-install flows require a valid Smithery/system MCP configuration in environments that use those templates.

# v1.8.3-beta.2 — A2A Async Communication, Image Context & Search Tools

## What's New

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Async Communication — Beta
- **Three communication modes** for `send_message_to_agent`:
  - `notify` — fire-and-forget, one-way announcement
  - `task_delegate` — delegate work and get results back asynchronously via `on_message` trigger
  - `consult` — synchronous question-reply (original behaviour)
- **Feature flag**: controlled at the tenant level via Company Settings → Company Info → A2A Async toggle (default: **OFF**)
- When disabled, the `msg_type` parameter is **hidden from the LLM** so agents only see synchronous consult mode
- Security: chain depth protection (max 3 hops), regex filtering of internal terms, SQL injection prevention
- Performance: async wake sessions use the agent's own `max_tool_rounds` setting (default 50)

### Multimodal Image Context
- Base64 image markers are now persisted to the database at write time
- Chat UI correctly strips `[image_data:]` markers and renders thumbnails
- Fixed chat page vertical scrolling (flexbox `min-height: 0` constraint)
- Removed deprecated `/agents/:id/chat` route

### Search Engine Tools
- New `Exa Search` tool — AI-powered semantic search with category filtering
- New standalone search engine tools: DuckDuckGo, Tavily, Google, Bing (each as own tool)

### UI Improvements
- Drag-and-drop file upload across the application
- Chat sidebar polish: segment control, session items styling
- Agent-to-agent sessions now visible in the admin "Other Users" tab

### Bug Fixes
- DingTalk org sync rate limiting to prevent API throttling
- Tool seeder: `parameters_schema` now correctly included in new tool INSERT
- Unified `msg_type` enum references across codebase
- Docker access port corrected to 3008

---

## v1.8.3-beta.2 — Bug Fixes

### A2A Chat History Fixes
- **A2A session now shows both sides of the conversation**: when a target agent is woken via `notify` or `task_delegate`, its reply is now mirrored into the shared A2A chat session so the full conversation is visible in the admin **Other Users** tab
- **Removed hardcoded 2-round tool call limit** for A2A wake invocations: agents were hitting the limit before completing basic tasks; they now use their own configurable `max_tool_rounds` setting (default 50)
- **Fixed message loading order**: sessions with many messages (e.g. long-running A2A threads) were only showing the oldest 500 messages; now correctly loads the most recent 500

## Upgrade Guide

> **Database migration required.** Run `alembic upgrade heads` to add the `a2a_async_enabled` column.

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
git pull origin main

# Run database migration
docker exec clawith-backend-1 alembic upgrade heads

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build
```

### Source Deployment

```bash
git pull origin main

# Run database migration
alembic upgrade heads

# Rebuild frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
cd ..

# Restart services
```

### Kubernetes (Helm)

```bash
helm upgrade clawith helm/clawith/ -f values.yaml
# Run migration job for a2a_async_enabled column
```

### Notes
- The A2A Async feature is **disabled by default**. No behaviour changes until explicitly enabled.
- The `a2a_async_enabled` column defaults to `FALSE`, so existing tenants are unaffected.
